## Subarray with given sum

Variation 1:  
Given an unordered array and a target, find a continuous subarray whose sum is equal to the target

Variation 2:  
Returns the count of subarrays that add upto the target number

Variation 3:  
Given an unsorted array of integers, find a pair with given sum in it

Variation 4:  
Given an unsorted array of integers, find a pair with given sum in it -- _Solution using Sorting_  
Time Complexity == O(nlog(n))

Variation 5:  
Given an unsorted array of integers, find a pair with given sum in it -- _Solution using Hashing_  
Time Complexity == O(n)
